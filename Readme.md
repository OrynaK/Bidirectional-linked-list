# Linked list container

You need to implement the interface [DomainList](src/main/java/ua/nure/cpp/kasapova/practice3/list/DomainList.java)
which internally contains a linked sequence of nodes.

## Requirements

1. Entity classes must be placed to the `ua.nure.cpp.<your last name>.practice3.entity` package.
   - Each entity class MUST have constructor without parameters  
   and can have any other constructors if you want.
   - Its highly recommended override equals, hashCode, toString methods.
2. Implementor must be placed to the `ua.nure.cpp.<your last name>.practice3.list` package.
   - Implementor MUST have constructor without parameters  
     and can have any other constructors if you want.

> You can use [Demo](src/main/java/ua/nure/cpp/kasapova/practice3/Demo.java) 
  for you needs. This class is not under tests.

## Testing

To ensure that you implement the interface correctly you must run all tests in the [test/java](src/test/java) folder.\
To run a test right click on a test class and select `Run <a class name>` 
or open a test class and run a method annotated with `@Test`. \
Using such way you can run All test in the project if you right click on the `test/java` folder.
